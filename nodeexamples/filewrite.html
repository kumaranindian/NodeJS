    The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 
    3rd millennium BCEâ€”one of the world's earliest civilisations. In the following
     millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed.
      Large-scale urbanisation occurred on the Ganges in the first millennium BCE 
      leading to the Mahajanapadas, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political
       consolidations took place under the Maurya, Satavahana and Gupta empires; 
       the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia.
        In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, 
        and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the 
        north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara
         Empire. The country was unified in the 17th century by the Mughal Empire.
          In the 18th century, the subcontinent came under the Maratha Empire and 
          in the 19th under the British East India Company, later shifting to 
          British crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th 
          century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent 
          resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.
